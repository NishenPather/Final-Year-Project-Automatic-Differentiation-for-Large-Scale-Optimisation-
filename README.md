# Final-Year-Project-Automatic-Differentiation-for-Large-Scale-Optimisation-

This repo contains the code utilised in my final year mechatronics project: Automatic Differentiation for Large Scale Optimisation. The project report may be found at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l7IRcx6A4jI9tmtNn4vwXUsq0T2nJONL/view?usp=sharing 

There are 3 folders, one for each of the experiments performed.
Experiment 1 contains non-linear least squares problem datasets from NIST (https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/strd/nls/nls_main.shtml)

Experiment 2 contains regression datasets from a repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php)

Experiment 3 contains bundle adjustment datasets made available by the university of washington (https://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/bal/)
