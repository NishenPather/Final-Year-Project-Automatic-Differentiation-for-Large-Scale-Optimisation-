This folder contains the 3 notebooks. 2 perform optimisation of neural networks on the ABA and REA datasets (ABA NN and REA NN respectively) and one performs optimisation of neural networks on various generated data (the function wishing to be tested needs to be uncommented within Generated Data NN).

When running the ABA NN or REA NN notebooks, please the ensure abalone.data or RealEstate.xlsx are stored in the same place as their associated notebook.

Within each notebook, either the block labelled as LM or Pytorch Gradient Descent needs to be uncommented depending on the which optimisation you are wishing to implemented
