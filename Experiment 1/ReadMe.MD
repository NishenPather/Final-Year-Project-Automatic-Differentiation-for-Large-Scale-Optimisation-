This folder contains notebook files for each NIST dataset used. 

To perform the Levenberg-Marquadt method on any of the datasets the .data file must be stored in the same 
place as the notebook. Additionally, either the numerical differentiaion or auto diff code must be commented 
out (depending on which method you wish to evaluate) before the program is run.
